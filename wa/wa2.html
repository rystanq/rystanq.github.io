    <p>Hello ! My name is <strong>Rystan Qualls</strong>, pronounced <em>wrist-in</em>, and I use
        he/him pronouns. I am a sophomore at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design,
        and my goal for this course are to make a fine polished portfolio I can use to showcase my skills in the future.
        I am a big fan of the arts, with Basquiat being my favorite painter, and im lucky enough to own some of his original works !
