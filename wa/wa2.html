    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio ! </h1>
    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>Hello ! My name is <em>Rystan</em>, pronounced <strong>wrist-in</strong>, and I use
        he/him pronouns. I am a sophomore at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design,
        and my goal for this course are to make a fine polished portfolio I can use to showcase my skills in the future.
        I am a big fan of the arts, with Basquiat being my favorite painter, and im lucky enough to own some of his original works !
